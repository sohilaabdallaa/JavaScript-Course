        transformation of the restaurant business landscape in Egypt. This approach allows restaurant owners to
        concentrate on growth while we manage the complexities of their operations.

        In light of the economic challenges and inflation, how is the pursuit of digitization reflected in the

        Our commitment lies in providing the F&B sector with innovative digital solutions to empower businesses to

        forward-thinking approach, actively listening to our customers and partners to foster new ideas and expedite
        digital transformation in the sector. This strategy not only propels our growth but also aligns seamlessly with
        Egypt’s 2030 vision, emphasizing digitalization and innovation across industries.

        restaurant management solution (RMS) and an all-inclusive Point of Sale solution (POS) that streamlines
        operations from orders to inventory on a single platform. To boost sales, we offer Foodics Online, enabling
        customers to directly order and pay through our website/application, thereby eliminating intermediaries and
        cutting down on external commission costs. Similarly, Foodics Kiosk enhances efficiency and profitability by

        addition, Foodics Accounting, which was introduced in 2023 to our clients in Egypt, offers a specialized
        accounting solution for the F&B industry, integrating with the RMS for accurate, real-time financial data
        management. Finally, we also offer a solution for multi-branch brands where the restaurant owners can manage all
        the branches with ease and efficiency from one platform and take the business operations to the next level.
